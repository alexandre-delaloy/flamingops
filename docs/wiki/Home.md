# Flamingops Documentation
This Github wiki serves as the documentation for Flamingops, the Cloud Provider aggregator.

This documentation should help Flamingops developers familiarise with the resources available and how to consume them with HTTP requests. It also includes informations about the Flamingops workflow.

You can navigate between pages with the navigation bar on the right side of the screen (or on the bottom end, depending of your viewport width).
